# Tic Tac Toe: Human vs AI

## Problem Statement

Your task is to build a **Tic Tac Toe game** using either **C** or **Python**, where:

- One player is a **human** who provides input via keyboard.
- The other player is an **AI opponent** that makes intelligent decisions.

---

## Gameplay Requirements

- The game should run in the terminal or console.
- The board must be displayed after each move.
- The human player should be prompted to enter their move (e.g., cell number or coordinates).
- The AI should respond with its move immediately after the human.
- The game must detect and announce:
  - A win (for either player)
  - A draw (when the board is full and no winner)

---

## AI Behavior

You are free to design the AI logic, but it must follow a **non-random strategy**.

- **Approach**: Try to win if possible, block the human if needed, otherwise pick the best available spot.

---

## Completion Criteria

- The game runs without errors.
- The board updates correctly after each move.
- Win/draw conditions are accurately detected.
- The AI behaves logically and consistently.

---

## ðŸ’¡ Bonus Challenges

- Add a graphical interface using `pygame` (Python) or any C graphics library.
- Track scores across multiple rounds.
- Let the player choose who goes first.
